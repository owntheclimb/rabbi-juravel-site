## Teaching Philosophy
"Whatever messages I hope to give over, I try to give myself. When Rav Dovid 
Lebowitz was giving a mussar shmuess in yeshiva, he used to say, 'I'm talking 
to myself. If anyone wants to listen, they can.' I feel the same way. I'm 
talking to myself, and my listeners and I are growing together."
